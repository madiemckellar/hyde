Welcome to my first github website, there I attempt to debunk climate information spread to the public in hopes to provide a more accurate understanding of the potential future we are facing regarding the climate crisis. This website was constructed for a __Climate Change research assignment within McMaster University's Integrated Science Program (ISCI 3A12)__. 

Climate change is a major issue affecting everyone. It is evident that the false claims bring spread on social media and in the news can lead the general public to be misinformed, possibly making decisions without accurate information. It is my belief that if we are to make the changes that need to be done for our planet, everyone must understand the factual data collected and can make a sound decision on the evidence gathered. 

> We must act _together_, with a knowledgeable and sound understanding of climate change facts.
