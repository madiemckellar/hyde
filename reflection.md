# Reflection 
## Part 1 Climate Claims Assignment
Some of the common themes among some of the more compelling articles that I read included ones that backed up information with peer-reviewed articles published in well-known journals such as Nature and Science Direct. Articles that did not support their claims with any sources were highly suspicious and lead me to believe it was fake news. I found that many of the posts I looked at used professional quotations to defend their arguments. It was highly influential for my trust towards the article when it was started exactly who the quotation was said by as well as their professional title. This allowed me to determine if I found them to be a trustworthy source that had qualifications for their knowledge. 

Common logical fallacies that were used among the papers included over generalizations, which made a large concrete claim on unknown areas of research. Other posts had oversimplification of the opposite side, making it seem as though there was only one logical answer. Many blog posts made large inaccurate claims that attempted to hook the audience and create the ‘wow’ factor, however failed to provide accurate evidence for the complex climate issues taking place.
