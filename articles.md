### 1. Analysis: Hurricanes Have Not Gotten More Intense or Frequent Over the Past 170 Years!

This post states that despite what the media says about hurricanes, climate and energy models report that they have not gotten worse or more frequent within the last 170 years. 

This blog made me question my beliefs about the worsening of hurricanes because it provided evidence from a peer-reviewed, published paper by Vecchi et al. It also said that due to their lack of technology, hurricanes before the 1970s were only analysed based on eyewitness, which makes me re-think if researchers can truly make a conclusion without the entire picture.

### 2.	Prince Charles’ Climate Friendly Automobile Runs on Fine Wine and Cheese!

This article states that Prince Charles’ Aston Martin car was made more environmentally friendly by a conversion process that allows it to run on old English wine and cheese.

I thought the title seemed very amusing yet impossible, however this article mentioned it was done using a very expensive conversion process and making special biofuels (from wine), which make me question if this was in fact possible considering Prince Charles’ status and wealth.

### 3. Guardian Accuses Big Business of Undermining Biden’s $3.5 Trillion Climate Plan!

This post states that Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Disney are supporting groups working against Biden’s new climate policy act, despite agreeing to support the plan.

This claim prompted me to rethink my previous belief that these companies were supporting Biden’s climate act because it presented group names such as the US Chamber of Commerce, which I have heard before in economic and climate news. I realize that these large companies can do things under the public’s eye, which also made me question the reliability of my previous climate change sources.

### 4.	The Emperor Penguin Extinction Scam & Sea Ice Dynamics!(

This article claimed that the climate models have inaccurately predicted the opposite affect for sea level dynamics, and states emperor penguins are not going extinct but flourishing in this environment. 

This article/video was posted by Jim Steele, a Director at San Francisco State University, author of the book Landscapes and Cycles and member of the CO2 Coalition, his title made me reconsider the possibility of Emperor penguin extinction being a scam portrayed by the news.

This article states that journalists at Sky News are reporting inaccurate claims about the course of flooding in London England. 

There has always been debate amiss reporters and scientists, however this paper made me question if any of the climate claims made on the news can be trusted. This blog attempted to back up their claim but providing some scientific measurements (figures) which made me question my prior beliefs.
