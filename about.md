Check out the **Article page** for a list of 5 Wattsupwiththat.com blog posts, briefly explaining the claim made in the post as well as why I found them to be particularly interesting. 

Check out the **Analysis page** for a comprehensive investigation of the blog titled *Hurricanes Have Not Gotten More Intense or Frequent Over the Past 170 Years!* written by an anonymous user.
