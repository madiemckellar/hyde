# Evalutation of Claim #1 
## Have hurricanes really been getting worse due to climate change? Or is this a *'wow'* factor portrayed in media. 



Among social media outlets, IPCC reports and various research documentations, it seems as though the behaviour of hurricanes within the last 200 years is controversial. Throughout my experience as a researcher, student, and citizen, I have thought that hurricanes were reportedly getting worse due to increasing global temperatures. However, I never heavily researched this area to determine if the claim of progressively worsened hurricanes’ is accurate and backed up with concrete evidence.


The argument being made in this article is that social media outlets have inaccurately reported the worsening of hurricane behaviour, despite having information that states they may be occurring with less frequently and power than before ([Anon, 2021](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/10/11/analysis-hurricanes-have-not-gotten-more-intense-frequent-over-past-170-years/)). This article presents a newly published Nature paper by Vecchi et al ([2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24268-5.)). incorporating a figure outlining the frequency of hurricanes, which was supposedly greater in the 1920s than it is today ([Anon, 2021](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/10/11/analysis-hurricanes-have-not-gotten-more-intense-frequent-over-past-170-years/)). This is of particular interest because it was my belief that the worsening of hurricanes was one of the effects stated in the IPCC reports, therefore this new evidence would contradict many reports prior to it being published.

Further evaluation of this article provided additional evidence to its reliability due to the published paper it received its information from. To begin, the purpose of this article was to provide information to the reader, and potentially uncover social media inaccuracies. I believe it was attempting to target the general public who does not have specialized knowledge of this field, as it simply summarizes the highly academic and professional nature of the Vecchi et al. paper. This blog post also incorporates an image that is very informative to the reader, which further helps understand the claim it is supporting. This article is written anonymously (by a so called ‘Guest Blogger’) which is highly suspicious due to the lack of information, background, and most likely qualification. However, their evidence for the claim was backed up using the paper published by Nature, which is a highly professional, peer-reviewed scientific journal that is very reliable. 


To further analyse this claim I found another blog post published by ScienceNews where it was stated that 
>"Hurricanes may not be becoming more frequent, but they’re still more dangerous" ([Gramling, 2021](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hurricanes-frequency-danger-climate-change-atlantic)).


This blog post was written with greater professionality where it cited the same [2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24268-5.) paper by Vecchi et al. However, this blog analyzed more details of the report presenting data that showed over the last 170 years there was no increase in hurricane frequency. Although various papers state this result could be due to the decreased aerosol pollution acting to counteracts the hurricanes, there is no evidence suggesting this is the exact mechanism ([Gramling, 2021](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/hurricanes-frequency-danger-climate-change-atlantic)). This  post included many additional sources that supported its claim. It is both interesting and important to note that the primary blog post being analyzed fails to state that in the Vecchi et al. paper, it was reported that hurricanes have become worse due to the increased deaths and rainfall ([Vecchi et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24268-5.)). Although the anonymous author does support the claim with a reliable source, it does not show the entire story. The conclusion being that there is not enough well-known history and concrete data to interpretate the entirely of hurricane behaviour, despite making a clearly objectified claim. 


Upon taking another look at the IPCC reports, it is evident that there is contradictory information on coastal fluctuations leading to increased deaths associated with hurricanes, however not direct implications of increased frequency of hurricanes due to climate change ([Seneviratne et al., 2012](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139177245.006.)). 
>Indications of other environmental factors leading to worsened storm-surge, winds, flooding and rainfall have resulted in worsened effects of hurricanes, ([Mudd et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000128.)) however it is unknown whether this is directly linked to the increasing intensity of the hurricanes themselves or the decreased environmental recovery ability due to climate change ([Mudd et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000128.)). 


Studies conducted prior to this year also stated that **hurricane history is only ‘predicted’ due to the lack of technology available before the 1970s**. Many researchers state that the uncertainties of the extreme storm changes cannot be analyzed with complete accuracy due to variations in models ([Kunkel et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00262.1)). An interesting finding reported that the increasing trend of hurricane severity and frequency was due to sparce reporting ships and their inability to detect storms as seen in Figure 1 ([Vecchi & Knutson, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1175/2010JCLI3810.1)). This missing data could be the reason some researchers and social media outlets emphasized this increasing behaviour as presented in figure 2a, which was supported before the current data (figure 2b) was released.

**Figure 1:** *Original HURDAT data records (A) compared to adjusted hurricane values (B), when taking into consideration the missing reports of storms from 1878 to 2008. A  positive trend is seen with the HURFAT data records, however, after addition of the potential missing values, a negative trend is reported for hurricane frequency.* *\[Image adjusted from ([Vecchi & Knutson, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1175/2010JCLI3810.1))]*


Overall, it is evident that although the **anonymous blog post being analyzed does incorporate *some reliable information*, it does not explain the entire story** and leads the reader to believe this is a simple conclusion. Upon further research I have discovered that **reports do not show increased hurricane frequency, although the intensity of the storms remains unknown** due to the lack of data. The recently published [2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24268-5.) paper does support claims presented in the anonymous blog post, however the blog fails to provide contradictory information on climate change effects and the earths decreasing recovery ability.  Perhaps, we must continue to wait and collect more data in future years before truly understanding the association between hurricanes and climate change.
